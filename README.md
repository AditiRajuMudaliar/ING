# Introduction to Python - Please read!

Hello dear participant! Thank you for choosing to be a part of this amazing event! We are thrilled to have you on board. 
This page will provide you with detailed instructions on how to set up all the necessary pre-requisites for the workshop.

but first......

However, we understand that some of these tools may be new to you. That's perfectly okay! We will guide you through each step and explain everything gradually. It's important to know that you don't have to grasp everything immediately, and you are not expected to become a professional software developer after this workshop.

This day is just meant to give you a glimpse at what it means to build tech products, and to show you it is not as scary as it looks.
You don't need to understand every aspect in fine detail.
Sometimes, following the instructions and progressing to the next step is perfectly fine. In fact, even experienced developers often solve problems in this way!

Please remember to believe in yourself and approach this day with a mindset of getting the most out of it.

We strongly believe that we need more women in tech. Diversity bring more angles and ideas, and more ideas mean better solutions, and better solutions means a better industry.
